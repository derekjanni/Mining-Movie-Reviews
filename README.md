# Predicting Academy Award Success:

For this project, I learned how to use `Beautiful Soup` to scrape [IMDB](imdb.com) for HTML data about films that were
nominated or awarded at the Academy Awards. I then built a series of Linear Models for predicting success at the awards and 
tested their effectiveness at predicting which movies would win an award.

This project contains a iPython Notebook with a complete write-up and codebase for the project. If you're more interested in a
distilled version check out my blog post on this project [here](http://derekjanni.github.io/predicting-academy-award-success/).
